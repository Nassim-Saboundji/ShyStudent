# ShyStudent
Website for professors to receive anonymous questions about courses they teach.


Students can be shy to ask questions in class. ShyStudent offers the ability to the professor to really know if his students
are understanding what is being taught. He can create a room for a given course and recieve questions from students while teaching the class.
At any point the teacher can stop and check if there are any questions on ShyStudent then the teacher can continue the class by answering any questions.
